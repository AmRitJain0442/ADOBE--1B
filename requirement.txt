# Pre-trained Models Used:
# 1. sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~90MB) - Fast semantic embeddings
# 2. distilbert-base-uncased (~250MB) - Smart decision engine for dynamic analysis
# 
# Total model size: ~340MB
# CPU-only optimized for production deployment (no GPU required)
# Uses CPU-only PyTorch builds to reduce image size and ensure compatibility

# NLTK Data Downloads (automatic):
# - punkt: Sentence tokenization
# - stopwords: English stopwords corpus

# System Features:
# - Zero hardcoded keywords - fully dynamic semantic analysis
# - Production-ready keyword extraction using compound patterns
# - Context-aware persona adaptation
# - CPU-optimized inference (no GPU required)
# - Intelligent answer generation with persona-specific styling
